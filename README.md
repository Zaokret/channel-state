## Overview

`channel-state` is a lightweight, powerful state management library designed for modern web applications. It leverages the native `BroadcastChannel` API to seamlessly synchronize state across all browser contexts (tabs, windows, iframes) of the same origin. With an optional persistence layer using `IndexedDB`, it ensures your application's state can be restored across sessions, providing a fluid user experience.

Built with TypeScript and with zero external dependencies, `channel-state` offers a minimal footprint and maximum flexibility. It includes dedicated, easy-to-use wrappers for popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, making integration a breeze.

## üéØ Common Use Cases

- **Shopping Carts:** Keep a user's shopping cart synchronized across multiple tabs. If they add an item in one tab, it instantly appears in all others.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Display notifications (e.g., "You have a new message") across all open tabs simultaneously.
- **User Authentication:** When a user logs in or out in one tab, automatically update the authentication state in all other tabs.
- **Collaborative Tools:** In simple collaborative applications, synchronize form data or other shared state between users on the same machine.
- **Feature Flags & Settings:** Update application settings or feature flags in one tab and have them apply everywhere immediately.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Cross-Context Synchronization:** Automatically syncs state across all tabs and windows using the `BroadcastChannel` API.
- **Optional State Persistence:** Persist state to `IndexedDB` to restore it after page reloads or browser restarts.
- **Framework-Agnostic Core:** The `@channel-state/core` package works with any JavaScript project.
- **Official Framework Wrappers:** Idiomatic and optimized integrations for [React](./packages/react/), [Vue](./packages/vue/), and [Svelte](./packages/svelte/).
- **Zero Dependencies:** The core library is incredibly lightweight with no third-party dependencies.
- **TypeScript Native:** Written entirely in TypeScript for robust type safety.
